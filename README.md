A simple, opinionated project seed for http APIs based on Node.js and Express featuring:

* [Typescript](www.typescriptlang.org)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) enforcing standard style (haha, I said it's opinionated...).
* dev mode (watch and recompile files, restart server)
* secured routes (token based authentication)
* Docker deployment (docker-compose)
* redis persistence

* showcase automatic tests (unit, integration)

- small smoke test

* maybe a minimal frontend for better demo

- process manager (auto-restart, mailing in case of incidents?)
- Some useful [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) settings and extension recommendations.
- what about helmet?! (adds some header attributes)
